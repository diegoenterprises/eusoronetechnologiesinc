# EusoTrip Master Design Code - S.E.A.L. Team 6 Final Delivery

This document serves as the final, definitive **Master Design Code Shell** for the EusoTrip platform, representing a pixel-perfect replication of the live application's visual and structural elements. This shell is the foundation upon which all backend logic and feature development must be built.

## 1. Master Code Source

The entire design system is now consolidated into a single file for absolute fidelity and ease of deployment:

*   **File:** `frontend/design-system/index.html`
*   **Content:** Contains all HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript shell logic (for login/app switching and dynamic content placeholders) embedded within the file.

This approach ensures that the "look and feel" is consistent and uncompromised, serving as the **exact template** for the rest of the development team.

## 2. Key Design Elements Replicated (Pixel-Perfect)

| Element | Description | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color Palette** | Dark mode theme with blue/purple gradients and specific accent colors. | Defined in the `<style>` block using CSS Variables (`:root`). |
| **ESANG AI Button** | Circular, pulsing button for AI activation. | `esang-ai-button` class with `border-radius: 50%` and `@keyframes pulse` animation. |
| **Footer Details** | Copyright and Platform Status banner. | Fixed at the bottom of the viewport, including the dynamic `User Type: CATALYST` placeholder. |
| **Sidebar Navigation** | Dark background, active gradient state for the selected menu item. | `sidebar` and `a.active` classes with `linear-gradient` background. |
| **Dashboard Layout** | Welcome card, 4-column stats grid, and shipment list structure. | Detailed HTML structure and specific CSS classes (`welcome-card`, `stats-grid-large`, `shipment-card`) for exact visual spacing and component presentation. |
| **Dynamic Content** | Placeholders for user name, stats, and shipment details. | Embedded in the JavaScript `renderDashboardContent()` function, ready for replacement by backend data. |

## 3. Implementation Guidelines for Development Teams

The development team must use the `index.html` as the **visual contract**.

1.  **Extraction:** The HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript functions should be extracted and integrated into the chosen frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
2.  **CSS/Styling:** The CSS within the `<style>` tags must be maintained as the primary source of truth for all components and layout.
3.  **JavaScript Logic:** The `renderLoginScreen()` and `renderAppShell()` functions provide the necessary state-switching logic. The content within `renderDashboardContent()` is the static template that must be dynamically generated by the backend-integrated frontend components.

This shell is now the **Master Design Code**. Any deviation from its visual output must be approved by the UI/UX lead.
