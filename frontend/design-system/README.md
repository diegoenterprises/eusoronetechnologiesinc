# EusoTrip Master Frontend Design Code - S.E.A.L. Team 6

This directory contains the **Master Frontend Design Code** for the EusoTrip platform, as developed by S.E.A.L. Team 6.

The entire design system, including the shell, styles, and core logic, is consolidated into a single file to ensure the highest fidelity and single source of truth for the design.

## Key Files:

*   **`index.html`**: Contains the complete, final, and approved master code for the Login Screen and the main Application Shell (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). This is the **single source of truth** for the visual design.
*   **`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`**: Comprehensive documentation explaining the embedded design tokens, layout, and logic.

## Usage for Other Teams:

The recommended approach for other development teams is to:

1.  **Extract:** Parse the embedded CSS and JavaScript from `index.html` into your framework's component structure (e.g., React components, Vue templates).
2.  **Maintain Fidelity:** Ensure all extracted design tokens and class names are preserved to maintain the "Perfected Design."

Refer to **`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`** for a detailed breakdown of the embedded styles and logic.
